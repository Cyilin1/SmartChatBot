# **Advanced Reasoning Models with RAG: Hands-On Tutorial**

## Overview
This hands-on tutorial focuses on using NVIDIA's reasoning model, [Nemotron](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemotron-nano-8b-v1), to build an intelligent chatbot. The chatbot will be enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to answer questions based on external knowledge sources.

### What You Will Learn:
1. **Reasoning Models**: Understand how to use NVIDIA's Nemotron reasoning model to process complex queries with dynamic control over reasoning modes (on/off).
2. **RAG Integration**: Learn how to combine retrieval techniques with reasoning models for context-aware and accurate responses.
3. **Custom Knowledge Base**: Explore how to load, transform, and query custom documents (e.g., PDFs) using LangChain.
4. **Hands-On Implementation**: Build a reusable Python class to interact with the reasoning model and integrate RAG seamlessly.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working system capable of leveraging advanced reasoning capabilities while grounding responses in retrieved knowledge.
